            Problem:
            National Rail faced a critical challenge in managing vegetation on the railway estate to maintain safety standards and optimize resource allocation. The existing processes were inefficient and lacked a comprehensive solution for surveying and monitoring vegetation growth. This necessitated the development of a web-based application to revolutionize how National Rail and their maintenance teams handled this critical aspect of railway management.

            Approach:
            In my role as a Technical Authority within the Creative Design Practice at Atkins Global, I led the initiative to address these challenges. My approach was built on the following key elements:

            Collaboration with Data Science Teams: I collaborated closely with Data Science teams to harness pioneering LIDAR technology. We explored how this technology could be implemented to scan and survey railway embankments and key infrastructure. The data collected would serve as a foundational component for the application.

            User-Centered Design: I took a user-centered design approach to understand the needs and pain points of National Rail maintenance teams and leadership stakeholders across various locations in the UK. This approach ensured that the application would be intuitive and genuinely beneficial for end-users.

            Figma Prototyping and UI Design: Leveraging Figma, I developed prototypes and high-fidelity UI designs. These designs aimed to not only provide a visually appealing interface but also ensure that the application's functionality aligns seamlessly with user expectations.

            Solution:
            The result of this initiative was a transformative solution that addressed National Rail's vegetation management challenges effectively:

            LYDAR-Powered Data Collection: The integration of LIDAR technology enabled the automated scanning and surveying of railway embankments and critical infrastructure. This data was then seamlessly fed into the web-based application, providing maintenance teams and leadership stakeholders with accurate and up-to-date information on vegetation growth and railway conditions.

            User-Focused Application: The application was designed with the end-users in mind. It provided intuitive tools for planning maintenance work and allocating resources more efficiently. By closely involving maintenance teams and leadership stakeholders throughout the design process, we ensured that the application met their specific needs.

            Efficiency and Safety: The application significantly improved the efficiency of vegetation management on the railway estate. By optimizing resource allocation and providing real-time data on vegetation growth, National Rail could enhance safety standards and allocate resources more effectively.

            In conclusion, the development of the National Rail Vegetation Management Application was a successful endeavor that exemplified the power of collaborative design thinking and cutting-edge technology integration. This transformative solution empowered National Rail to proactively manage vegetation, enhance safety, and improve the efficiency of their operations across multiple locations in the UK.
